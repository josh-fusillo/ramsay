        Its Ramsay's world and you're just living in it. Welcome to my "Ruff"
        life. My name is Ramsay. I'm a 5 year old frug (pug/fr bulldog) living
        in Toronto. My momma lost her job twice last year and while she was
        heartbroken and stressed, it meant I got to spend all my time snuggling
        and cheering her up. After wondering what she would do for work now,
        after the crazy that was 2020. She decided to take advantage of her new
        love of baking and all the business skills she had learned from all her
        jobs. Then she came up with the best idea ever! To stay at home and make
        treats for me all day. At first I was sad when she said I'd have to
        share, but then I realized it meant I could share my favourite recipes
        with all of you. Knowing that coconut oil is good for dog's skin and
        fur, she looked into baking treats with coconut flour and found out it's
        great for my health as well. After a bit more research she learned that
        there were few, if any commercially baked treats made with coconut
        flour. Wanting to provide a healthy and tasty treat combined with
        another pandemic lockdown, Ramsay's recipe's was born. Using only
        ingredients you can pronounce and lots of love, my momma bakes fresh and
        yummy treats for us all to eat. So from my dog house to your's. Enjoy,
        Love RAMSAY
